/**
* Map Container
*
* Implements a map container type.
* The type of the key and the value is string (char *)
* The map has an internal iterator for external use. For all functions
* where the state of the iterator after calling that function is not stated,
* it is undefined. That is you cannot assume anything about it.
*
* The following functions are available:
*   mapCreate		- Creates a new empty map
*   mapDestroy		- Deletes an existing map and frees all resources
*   mapCopy		- Copies an existing map
*   mapGetSize		- Returns the size of a given map
*   mapContains	- returns weather or not a key exists inside the map.
*   mapPut		    - Gives a specific key a given value.
*   				  If the key exists, the value is overridden.
*   mapGet  	    - Returns the data paired to a key which matches the given key.
*					  Iterator status unchanged
*   mapRemove		- Removes a pair of (key,data) elements for which the key
*                    matches a given element (using the strcmp function).
*   mapGetFirst	- Sets the internal iterator to the first key in the
*   				  map, and returns it.
*   mapGetNext		- Advances the internal iterator to the next key and
*   				  returns it.
*	 mapClear		- Clears the contents of the map. Frees all the elements of
*	 				  the map using the free function.
* 	 MAP_FOREACH	- A macro for iterating over the map's elements.
